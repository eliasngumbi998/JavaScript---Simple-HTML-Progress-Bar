# JavaScript---Simple-HTML-Progress-Bar
In this tutorial we will create a Simple HTML Progress Bar using JavaScript. This code will automatically display an animated progress bar when the user click the launch button. The code use onclick() to launch the animated progress bar by incrementing the width properties of an element again and again until it reach the maximum width by using setInterval(). This is a user-friendly program feel free to modify it.  We will use JavaScript to add some new feature to the website interface by actually written into an HTML page. It is what gives your page a different interactive elements and animation that engage a user.
